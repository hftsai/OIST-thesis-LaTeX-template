\chapter{How to use this template} \label{ch-2}

This is a practical guide into how to use this template, by explaining the role of the different folders and \texttt{Thesis.tex}, the main file.

\section{Folders}

The main folder contains three folders detailed here:

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Images.} This folder should contain all the images that you will use in your thesis. It can contain subfolders, for example one for each chapter. To include an image from the main text, use something like \texttt{\textbackslash includegraphics\{subfolder/image.jpg\} } without worrying about the \texttt{Images} path.

\item \textbf{MainText.} This folder contains a series of \LaTeX\ files that form the main text: introduction, chapters, conclusion and appendices. The introduction and conclusion as they are now are not numbered, which creates a few difficulties with the headers of the thesis. Those are solved by including the commands \texttt{\textbackslash unnumberedchapter\{\}} and \texttt{\textbackslash numberedchapter} before including the files in \texttt{Thesis.tex}. If you want the introduction and conclusion to be numbered, re-write them as regular chapters.  

\item \textbf{Preamble.} This folder contains a series of \LaTeX\ files with the pages that will appear before the main text. Please write (or copy and paste) your own text in those files and delete the dummy text when appropriate. The files are:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{abbreviations.tex} --- List of abbreviations. If the list goes over one page, create another table.
\item \texttt{abstract.tex} --- Abstract. Follow directions in the file.
\item \texttt{acknowledgments.tex} --- Acknowledgments. Follow directions in the file.
\item \texttt{declaration.tex} --- Declaration of Original and Sole Authorship. Only modify the last item. This page needs to be signed once printed.
\item \texttt{dedication.tex} --- Dedication (optional). Should only be a very few lines.
\item \texttt{glossary.tex} --- Glossary (optional). If the list goes over one page, create another table.
\item \texttt{mydefinitions.tex} --- \textbf{Important} ---This file should contain all your definitions and the \LaTeX\ packages that you usually use. For example, if you use math symbols, you should include \texttt{\textbackslash usepackage\{amsmath\}} in that file.
\item \texttt{nomenclature.tex} --- Nomenclature (optional). If the list goes over one page, create another table.
\item \texttt{physics\_bibstyle.bst} --- Bibliography style file modified by Jeremie Gillet in 2011 to suit his thesis. Might be suitable for physics. If you want to use another custom bibliography style, include the file in this folder.
\item \texttt{Thesis\_bibliography.bib} --- BibTeX file containing your bibliography.
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\section{\texttt{Thesis.tex}}

This is the main file, the only one that needs to be compiled to build the thesis. Compile once with \LaTeX, once with BibTeX and finally twice with \LaTeX\ to get all the references right.

Let's go through each section and comment them briefly.

\subsection{PACKAGES AND OTHER DOCUMENT CONFIGURATIONS}

This section contains the minimum number of packages and definitions to compile the thesis. No line should be removed or modified, with the exception of the last line that deals with how references appear in the text.

\subsection{COMPLETE THESE VALUES}

Variables are defined here with the author name, thesis title, etc. Those values will be used automatically in the title and various preamble files.

The submission date should be in the format ``Month, year''. 

The file \texttt{mydefinitions.tex} containing your own packages and definitions is included at this point.

\subsection{TITLE PAGE}

Creates the title page. Do not modify.

\subsection{PREAMBLE PAGES}

Structures the style (header) for the preamble pages and includes them. Do not modify, except for deleting the optional preambles you might not want to include.

\subsection{LIST OF CONTENTS/FIGURES/TABLES}

Creates the different lists. Do not modify.

\subsection{THESIS MAIN TEXT}

Structures the style (header) for the main text and builds it. 

The command \texttt{\textbackslash numberedchapter} is only relevant for a transition between unnumbered sections and numbered sections, it does not need to be included between each chapter. 

\subsection{APPENDICES}

Structures the style for the appendices and builds the text. The appendices are numbered with letters but are structured like regular chapters.

\subsection{BIBLIOGRAPHY}

Builds the bibliography. You may modify the bibliography style file depending on your needs.

\subsection{PUBLISHED ARTICLES}

This last section add the PDF files of your previously published articles (or about to be published) to the thesis. You should only include PDF files provided by the publishing journal. This is strictly for the examiners' convenience in this temporary bound, as for copyright reasons these files may not be published in the final version of the thesis.
