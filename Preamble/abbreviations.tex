\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Abbreviations}

All abbreviations used in the thesis should be listed here, with their definitions, in alphabetical order.  This includes trivial and commonly used abbreviations (at your own discretion), but not words that have entered into general English usage (such as laser or DNA).  In particular, non-standard abbreviations should be presented here.  This is an aid to the reader who may not read all sections of the thesis. \\
